Based on the provided data, I'll create the mermaid charts for each section.

### Competitor Ratings and Mindshare Visualization
```mermaid
pie
    title Competitor Mindshare
    "Elastic Search" : 15.6
    "Amazon Kendra" : 15.8
    "Azure Search" : 14.3
```

### USP Impact Visualization
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Niche Industry Customization] --> B[Increased Adoption]
    C[Enhanced User Analytics] --> D[Improved User Experience]
    E[AI-Driven Personalization] --> F[Enhanced User Engagement]
    G[Flexible Pricing Models] --> H[Broader Market Reach]
```

### Market Size Projection Visualization
```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Market Size Projection"
    x-axis "Year" [2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030]
    y-axis "Market Size (Billion USD)" 0 --> 5.5
    line [2.5, 2.875, 3.3, 3.8, 4.4, 5.0]
```

### Revenue Streams Distribution
```mermaid
pie
    title Revenue Streams Distribution
    "Subscriptions" : 60
    "Marketplace Fees" : 20
    "Advertising" : 10
    "Enterprise Licensing" : 10
```

### Cost Breakdown Visualization
```mermaid
pie
    title Initial Project Cost Estimate
    "Human Resources" : 30000
    "Tools & Software" : 8000
    "Time Allocation" : 0
```

Let's adjust the "Time Allocation" to be represented in a different chart as it is not a cost.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Development Timeline] -->|3 Months| B[Project Completion]
```

Here's a simple example. If you'd like to represent "Time Allocation" differently, please provide more context.

If you need any adjustments or have further requests, feel free to ask!
