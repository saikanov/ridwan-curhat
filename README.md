# Project Title

TaskFlow\
*Empower Your Solo Journey with Seamless Project Management*

## Overview of the Idea

TaskFlow is a streamlined project management tool tailored for solo-preneurs, enabling them to plan, track, and execute projects efficiently. It addresses the challenge of disorganized workflows and lack of actionable insights for individuals managing complex projects single-handedly. By leveraging AI to generate project scopes, automate repository setup, provide visual previews, and validate market fit, TaskFlow simplifies project management while offering intelligent, data-driven suggestions.

## Project Goal

The goal of TaskFlow is to demonstrate an agentic system that empowers solo-preneurs to manage projects with minimal effort. We aim to showcase a seamless, AI-driven experience that automates task organization, repository setup, project visualization, and market validation, proving that solo-preneurs can efficiently handle sophisticated projects without extensive manual planning.

## How It Works

- **User Flow**:

  1. **Project Setup**: Users input a general objective for the project (e.g., "Build a SaaS for task management") along with basic details (name, estimated income/outcome, timeline).
  2. **Task Organization**: AI (powered by Agno) automatically generates a project scope, implementation plan, and backlog with a hierarchical structure (Epic > Feature > Task) based on the general objective. Users manage these tasks via a drag-and-drop Kanban board (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done).
  3. **Repository Setup**: Users click a "Setup Project Repository" button, triggering an MCP GitHub workflow to create a GitHub repository and populate it with a README based on the project objective and scope.
  4. **Project Preview**: Users click a "Gave Some Preview" button, which uses browser automation to generate a simple mockup (e.g., landing page) via tools like v0.dev, genspark.ai, or lovable, displayed in the UI.
  5. **Market Validation**: Users initiate a market research task, where Firecrawl scrapes data on existing platforms, features, and pricing. Agno’s reasoning and Mem0’s memory chaining analyze the data to produce a Markdown report covering competitors, feature comparisons, pricing plans, and unique selling points (USPs) for the project.
  6. **Progress Tracking**: Users update task statuses on the Kanban board, with Mem0 ensuring context continuity across sessions.

- **Core Functionality**:

  - AI-generated project scope and backlog (Epic > Feature > Task) from a general objective
  - Kanban board for task management
  - Automated GitHub repository setup with MCP GitHub
  - Mockup generation for project visualization
  - Market research report generation for validation

- **Multimodal Elements**:

  - **Text**: Project objectives, task descriptions, README content, market research reports
  - **Visual**: Kanban board, task hierarchy visualization, mockup previews
  - **Interactive**: Drag-and-drop Kanban, buttons for repository setup and mockup generation, browser-based tool interactions

## Tools Used

- **Agno**: Orchestrates the agentic system, powering AI-driven scope generation, task hierarchy creation, and reasoning for market validation. Agno’s advanced capabilities ensure robust feature execution beyond basic LLMs, aligning with our commitment to sophisticated workflows.
- **Firecrawl**: Scrapes online data for market validation, collecting information on existing platforms, features, and pricing to inform the research report.
- **Mem0**: Provides memory chaining to maintain context across task generation, repository setup, mockup creation, and market research, preventing loss of critical information during multi-step processes.
- **Browser Use**: Automates interactions with v0.dev, genspark.ai, or lovable for mockup generation and GitHub for repository setup, streamlining user-triggered actions.

## UI Approach

The UI is clean, modern, and intuitive, designed for solo-preneurs with minimal overhead. Key elements include:

- A responsive React.js-based interface with a minimalist aesthetic
- A drag-and-drop Kanban board with colorful task cards reflecting the Epic > Feature > Task hierarchy
- A sidebar for project setup and objective input
- Dedicated buttons for “Setup Project Repository” and “Gave Some Preview” with real-time feedback
- A market research panel displaying Markdown reports with collapsible sections
- Green-accented CTAs for visual appeal
